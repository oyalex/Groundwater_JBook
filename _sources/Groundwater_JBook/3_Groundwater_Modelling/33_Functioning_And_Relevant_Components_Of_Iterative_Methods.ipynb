    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be capable of simulating groundwater flow with the help of computer models, a **system of equations** must be solved. As a result head values are calculated for each model cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each equation is based on the **conservation of volume** (for each cell) and **Darcy‘s Law** (for flow between adjacent cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, Gauß elimination is not useful due to the large number of equations and the associated large memory requirements of the computer. Therefore **iterative solution** methods are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "These require special input parameters to control the iterative procedure. An \"optimal\" parameter selection leads to an acceptable approximate solution within a few iteration steps. However, there is no guarantee that this will always be achieved.\n"

    "\n",
    "The solving of systems of finite difference equations is done by a **sequence of similar iterative steps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration step it is assumed that the approximate solution for the current time level is improved. This “update“ is **based on the intermediate result of the pre-vious iterative step**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The start value corresponds to the value for the iteration step **v = 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **transient problems**, the initial values are usually identical with the results of the previous time level (or with the initial values). The exception are cells with a fixed head boundary condition, since the heads are known at time level k and thus make an update unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **stationary problems**, the initial values must be estimated in advance. This can be done by using the initial values provided by the software, by transient modelling which approximates the steady state, or by estimating the values based on previous experience."

    "\n",
    "**Exception:** An error tolerance close to the accuracy of the computer can lead to rounding errors and correspondingly reduced quality of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
